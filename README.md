# Classifying Fashion MNIST with Deep Learning using limited data

The goal of the this project is to build a CNN model given only *one* training observertaion per class. 

## Dataset
We use Fashion-MNIST  dataset containing 70K images of 28x28 pixels that are size normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
However, the whole dataset is not made available. There are two subsets of this dataset. 

 * 1) subset contains 30000 labeled training examples of the classes 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9. 
 * 2) subset contains 5 labeled training exmaple from the classes 0, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (i.e., one per class) and 29992 unlabeled examples.

## Approach
TBD.
